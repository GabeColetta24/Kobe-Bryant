            <h2>Who is Kobe Bryant?</h2>
            <br>
            <div>
                <p>Kobe Bryant (born August 23, 1978, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died January 26, 2020, Calabasas,
                    California) was an American professional basketball player, who helped lead the Los Angeles Lakers
                    of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to five championships (2000–02 and 2009–10).</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Throughout his remarkable career, Bryant developed a heroic figure as he pursued Michael Jordan's
                    footsteps and overcoming him toward the end of his career. He is considered a hero because he has
                    the trait of being determined, fearless, and inspirational. Kobe Bryant was successful because of
                    his determined mindset. Which came to be known as "The Mamba Mentality", derived from his nickname
                    "The Black Mamba".
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Kobe married his wife Vanessa Bryant on 18th April 2001. They had four daughters: Natalia, Gianna,
                    Bianca and Capri Bryant. Gianna died alongside her father in a helicopter crash in 2020 when she was
                    13 years old. Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna, also known as Gigi, are immortalised in murals
                    around the city of Los Angeles.
                </p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <br>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Kobe was the youngest of three children and the only son of Pamela Cox Bryant and former NBA player
                    Joe Bryant. Bryant's parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe from Japan, which they saw on a
                    restaurant menu, possibly in Philadelphia. His middle name, Bean, was derived from his father's
                    nickname "Jellybean". Bryant's family was Catholic and he was brought up with this faith.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Bryant started playing basketball at the age of three, and the Lakers were his favourite team when
                    he was growing up. When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to
                    Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball. After two years, they moved first to
                    Reggio Calabria, then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia. Kobe became accustomed to his new lifestyle and
                    learned to speak fluent Italian. During summers, Bryant returned to the United States to play in a
                    basketball summer league. When he was 13, Bryant and his family moved back to Philadelphia, where he
                    enrolled in the eighth grade at Bala Cynwyd Middle School.

                <br>
                <h3>High School (1992-1996)</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high-school career at Lower Merion High
                    School in Ardmore, located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. He played on the varsity
                    basketball team as a freshman. Bryant became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower
                    Merion's varsity team, but the team finished with a 4–20 record. The following three years, the Aces
                    compiled a 77–13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions. During his junior year, Bryant
                    averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks and 2.3 steals and was named
                    Pennsylvania Player of the Year while also earning a fourth-team Parade All-American nomination,
                    attracting attention from college recruiters in the process. However, after high schooler Kevin
                    Garnett went in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft, Bryant also began contemplating going
                    directly to the pros.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As a senior, Bryant led the Aces to their first state championship in 53 years. During the run, he
                    averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4 steals, and 3.8 blocked shots in leading the Aces
                    to a 31–3 record. Bryant finished his high-school career as Southeastern Pennsylvania's all-time
                    leading scorer at 2,883 points, surpassing both Wilt Chamberlain and Lionel Simmons. Bryant received
                    several awards for his outstanding performance during his senior year at Lower Merion. These
                    included being named Naismith High School Player of the Year, Gatorade Men's National Basketball
                    Player of the Year, a McDonald's All-American, a first-team Parade All-American and a USA Today
                    All-USA First Team player.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, the 17-year-old Bryant decided to go directly into the NBA, becoming only the sixth
                    player in NBA history to do so.

            <div>
                <p>
                    In high school, Bryant was a member of a rap group called CHEIZAW, named after the Chi Sah gang in
                    the martial arts film Kid with the Golden Arm. The group was signed by Sony Entertainment, but the
                    company's ultimate goal was to eliminate the group and have Bryant record on his own. The label
                    wanted to capitalise on Bryant's youth and NBA fame. He performed at a 1997 concert by Sway & King
                    Tech and recorded a verse for a remix of Brian McKnight's "Hold Me." Bryant even appeared on Lakers
                    teammate O'Neal's Respect, starting the track "3 X's Dope", though Bryant's name was not listed on
                    the credits.

                    Bryant made his acting debut in 1996, appearing in an episode of Moesha. Bryant was also the subject
                    of Spike Lee's 2009 documentary film Kobe Doin' Work, which chronicled Bryant during the 2007–08 NBA
                    season. In 2018, Bryant became the first African-American to win the Academy Award for Best Animated
                    Short Film, and the first former professional athlete to be nominated for and win an Academy Award
                    in any category, for his film Dear Basketball. The film also won the Annie Award for Best Animated
                    Short Subject and a Sports Emmy Award. The film was produced by Bryant's production company, Granity
                    Studios. In addition to future animation projects, Bryant had been in talks with animator veteran
                    Bruce Smith for the last six months before his death about starting his own animation studio.
                    Beginning in 2018, Bryant wrote, produced and hosted the television series Detail, which aired for
                    multiple seasons on ESPN and ESPN+. It featured his insights into the game of basketball and
                    in-depth analysis of games and individual players. Bryant also appeared in Modern Family, The Last
                    Dance and The Redeem Team documentary.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Bryant was the official ambassador for After-School All-Stars (ASAS), an American non-profit
                    organisation that provides comprehensive after-school programs to children in 13 US cities. Bryant
                    also started the Kobe Bryant China Fund which partnered with the Soong Ching Ling Foundation, a
                    charity backed by the Chinese government. The Kobe Bryant China Fund raises money within China
                    earmarked for education and health programs. Bryant and his wife founded the Kobe and Vanessa Bryant
                    Family Foundation (KVBFF). Its goals are "helping young people in need, encouraging the development
                    of physical and social skills through sports and assisting the homeless." Bryant spoke of the
                    injustice aimed at homeless people who are blamed for their situation, saying that homelessness
                    should not be ignored or made a low priority. Bryant said he wanted more out of life than just a
                    successful basketball career. Bryant and his wife were also founding donors of the National Museum
                    of African American History and Culture, with Bryant also donating his uniform that he wore in the
                    2008 NBA Finals, the year Bryant was named the league MVP. During his lifetime, Bryant granted over
                    200 requests for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

                <br>
                <p>On October 23, 2018, Bryant's book The Mamba Mentality: How I Play, with photographs and afterword by
                    Andrew D. Bernstein, an introduction by Phil Jackson, and a foreword by Pau Gasol, was published by
                    MCD / Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The book looks back on his career with photos and his reflections.
                    Bryant also co-wrote/produced several young adult novels through Granity Studios: The Wizenard
                    Series: Training Camp, Legacy and the Queen, and Epoca: The Tree of Ecrof. A fourth novel, The
                    Wizenard Series: Season One, was released posthumously in March 2020. The Wizarenard Series: Season
