            <h2>Who is Kobe Bryant?</h2>
            <br>
            <div>
                <p>Kobe Bryant (born August 23, 1978, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died January 26, 2020, Calabasas,
                    California) was an American professional basketball player, who helped lead the Los Angeles Lakers
                    of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to five championships (2000–02 and 2009–10).</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Throughout his remarkable career, Bryant developed a heroic figure as he pursued Michael Jordan's
                    footsteps and overcoming him toward the end of his career. He is considered a hero because he has
                    the trait of being determined, fearless, and inspirational. Kobe Bryant was successful because of
                    his determined mindset. Which came to be known as "The Mamba Mentality", derived from his nickname
                    "The Black Mamba".
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Kobe married his wife Vanessa Bryant on 18th April 2001. They had four daughters: Natalia, Gianna,
                    Bianca and Capri Bryant. Gianna died alongside her father in a helicopter crash in 2020 when she was
                    13 years old. Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna, also known as Gigi, are immortalised in murals
                    around the city of Los Angeles.

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <br>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Kobe was the youngest of three children and the only son of Pamela Cox Bryant and former NBA player
                    Joe Bryant. Bryant's parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe from Japan, which they saw on a
                    restaurant menu, possibly in Philadelphia. His middle name, Bean, was derived from his father's
                    nickname "Jellybean". Bryant's family was Catholic and he was brought up with this faith.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Bryant started playing basketball at the age of three, and the Lakers were his favourite team when
                    he was growing up. When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to
                    Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball. After two years, they moved first to
                    Reggio Calabria, then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia. Kobe became accustomed to his new lifestyle and
                    learned to speak fluent Italian. During summers, Bryant returned to the United States to play in a
                    basketball summer league. When he was 13, Bryant and his family moved back to Philadelphia, where he
                    enrolled in the eighth grade at Bala Cynwyd Middle School.

                <h3>High School (1992-1996)</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high-school career at Lower Merion High
                    School in Ardmore, located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. He played on the varsity
                    basketball team as a freshman. Bryant became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower
                    Merion's varsity team, but the team finished with a 4–20 record. The following three years, the Aces
                    compiled a 77–13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions. During his junior year, Bryant
                    averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks and 2.3 steals and was named
                    Pennsylvania Player of the Year while also earning a fourth-team Parade All-American nomination,
                    attracting attention from college recruiters in the process. However, after high schooler Kevin
                    Garnett went in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft, Bryant also began contemplating going
                    directly to the pros.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As a senior, Bryant led the Aces to their first state championship in 53 years. During the run, he
                    averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4 steals, and 3.8 blocked shots in leading the Aces
                    to a 31–3 record. Bryant finished his high-school career as Southeastern Pennsylvania's all-time
                    leading scorer at 2,883 points, surpassing both Wilt Chamberlain and Lionel Simmons. Bryant received
                    several awards for his outstanding performance during his senior year at Lower Merion. These
                    included being named Naismith High School Player of the Year, Gatorade Men's National Basketball
                    Player of the Year, a McDonald's All-American, a first-team Parade All-American and a USA Today
                    All-USA First Team player.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, the 17-year-old Bryant decided to go directly into the NBA, becoming only the sixth player in NBA history to do so.
