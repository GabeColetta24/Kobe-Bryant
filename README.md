# Kobe Bryant

My goal with this project was to create a website where users can receive a reliable source of information on Kobe Bryant's life. I wanted to include all of his accomplishments on and off  the basketball court and give users an insight into Kobe's upbringing and who he was after his basketball career.

This site is targeted towards basketball and Kobe fans who want to know more about one of the greatest sportsman of all time.

## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar

Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery and Sign Up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.

This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

### The Hero Image

I used a picture of an iconic Kobe Bryant dunk as my hero image to draw users in when they first open the site.

### Professional Career & Accolades

This is the third section of my home page. In this section I wanted to give users an overview of what Kobe achieved throughout his basketball career both in the NBA and internationally. I also added a YouTube video link in this section in case users wanted to watch the highlights of one of his most iconic games.

### The Footer

The Footer section includes links to four of the most popular social media home pages. I used the home pages as I don't have any social media accounts for this website. The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.

### Gallery

I created the Gallery page (gallery.html) to provide the user with various iconic photos from Kobe's life. This section is valuable to the user as it gives visual proof of Kobe's successful life.

### Features I would like to add in the future

I would like to add a table showcasing Kobe's NBA career stats on the home page.

## Testing

I tested all of the features and links in my website in the preview page first and then in the deployed version once I had pushed my changes.

I also used the developer tool in chrome to ensure that the website looks and works correctly on different screen sizes.
For example: 

My title, hero image and sign up page background image will adjust in size depending on the screen size.

My gallery page will adjust how many columns should be used to present the images based on screen size.

My navbar will become a dropdown menu on mobile devices.

The content on my home page will adjust to fit different screen sizes.
