#Kobe Bryant

My goal with this project was to create a website where users can receive a reliable source of information on Kobe Bryant's life. I wanted to include all of his accomplishments on and off of the basketball court and give users an insight into Kobe's upbringing and who he was after his basketball career.

This site is targeted towards basketball and Kobe fans who want to know more about one of the greatest sportsman of all time.

##Existing Features

###Navigation Bar

Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery and Sign Up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.

This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

###The Hero Image

I used a picture of an iconic Kobe Bryant dunk as my hero image to draw users in when they first open the site.

###Who is Kobe Bryant?

This is the opening section of my home page. This was intended to give users an overview of who Kobe Bryant was on and off of the basketball court.

###Early Life

This is the second section of my home page. This was intended to give users an insight into Kobe's upbringing and explain how he started playing basketball and made his way to the NBA.

###Professional Career & Accolades

This is the third section of my home page. In this section I wanted to give users an overview of what Kobe achieved throughout his basketball career both in the NBA and internationally. I also added some YouTube video links in this section in case users wanted to watch the highlights of his most iconic games.

###Things you didn't know about Kobe Bryant

This is the final section of my home page. This was intended to give users an insight into who Kobe was off the basketball court, before, during and after his basketball career.

###The Footer

The Footer section includes links to four of the most popular social media home pages. I used the home pages as I don't have any social media accounts for this website. The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.

###Gallery

I created the Gallery page (gallery.html) to provide the user with various iconic photos from Kobe's life. This section is valuable to the user as it gives visual proof of Kobe's successful life.

###The Sign Up Page

This page allows the user to sign up to receive daily Kobe Bryant facts and motivational quotes. The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address.

###Features I would like to add in the future

I would like to add a table showcasing Kobe's NBA career stats on the home page.
